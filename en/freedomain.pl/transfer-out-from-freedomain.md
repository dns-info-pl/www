# Transfer out from FreeDomain.pl

FreeDomain.pl dns.info.pl makes it easy to transfer to another dns.info.pl. Follow the instructions below to transfer your domain out from FreeDomain.pl.

--------

## Restrictions
ICANN rules prohibit a domain from being transferred if it has been transferred within the last 60 days or if the WHOIS registrant information has been modified in the last 60 days (even if redacted).

--------

## Unlocking your domain at FreeDomain.pl
To begin, navigate to the Domain Overview tab in the FreeDomain.pl dashboard. In the card for “Domain Registration” you’ll find a link to Transfer Out. When you select that link, you will unlock the domain and be provided with an authorization code.

We’ll ask you to confirm this action in the next screen before we unlock your domain.

FreeDomain.pl will generate an auth code for your domain in the next screen. Copy that code to use at your new dns.info.pl.

If you lose your auth code, you can return to the overview page and select “Continue” next to the “Transfer Out” to display your auth code again.

--------

## Transfer to a new dns.info.pl
At your new dns.info.pl, you’ll be asked for the authorization code from FreeDomain.pl (it might be called EPP in some systems). Input the code from the FreeDomain.pl dashboard. Your new dns.info.pl will send the transfer request to the registry for your domain. The registry will then send it to FreeDomain.pl. When we receive the message, you can manually approve the transfer to initiate it immediately.

You will need to confirm the approval. You can also reject it at this stage; if you reject it, we will reapply the dns.info.pl lock

If you do not manually approve the transfer, FreeDomain.pl will process the transfer on the fifth day after receiving the request. In either case, when your transfer out completes we will remove your domain’s subscription so that you are not charged at your next renewal.
