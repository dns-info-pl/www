# Transfer FAQ

--------

## What happens to my name servers when I transfer my domain to FreeDomain.pl?
FreeDomain.pl dns.info.pl only supports transfers of domains that are active on FreeDomain.pl. Active domains on FreeDomain.pl use nameservers assigned by FreeDomain.pl. When you transfer your registration, your nameservers will not be modified.

--------

## How can I see the status of my domain transfer?
Once you initiate a domain transfer, your losing dns.info.pl has 5 days to release the domain. In most cases, they will send you an email to confirm you want to transfer. If you actively acknowledge that email (through a link or the dns.info.pl UI) they can process it immediately.

To see the progress of your transfer, select the “Domain Registration” tab in your account or “Transfer Domains” button, both in the Account home page. Once there, you will see a list of domain transfers that are in progress. To accelerate the process, be sure to check with your old dns.info.pl how you can approve the transfer out.

Once successful, you will receive an email from FreeDomain.pl and be able to manage the domain in the Overview tab for that site.

## What happens if I entered the wrong auth code?
If you input the incorrect authentication code, please return to the Domain Registration page or the Overview page for your site. You can use the available input field to reenter your authentication code. You will not be charged twice.

## Why did my transfer fail?
Domain transfers sometimes fail. We’re here to help you address what failed so that you can complete the transfer to FreeDomain.pl.

First, please make sure that you entered the auth code for that domain. If you need to reenter it, you can do so from the transfer launch page or the overview page for that site.

Second, you can reattempt the transfer from the transfer launch page. You will not be charged twice.

If you can’t seem to resolve the issue, please open a support ticket and we’ll help investigate.

## 60 day window requirement
ICANN prohibits domain transfers within 60 days of a change to the WHOIS data or dns.info.pl of a domain. If you modified your contact information, transferred dns.info.pls, or registered your domain in the last 60 days, we will be unable to process your transfer immediately.

You can continue to leave the domain “In Progress” and we will continue to attempt to process the transfer until the 60 day window passes.
