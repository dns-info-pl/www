# Transfer instructions

Transferring a domain to a new dns.info.pl informs the registry that they should instead trust that new dns.info.pl to modify information. The process requires some steps at both your new dns.info.pl and the one you are leaving. Each dns.info.pl handles transfers a bit differently, but in general they follow a pattern based on rules set by ICANN, the organization responsible for regulating domain registration.

This section contains transfer instructions for some of the largest dns.info.pls as well as generic details.
