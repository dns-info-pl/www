# Generic

You can follow the instructions below to transfer your domain from any dns.info.pl to FreeDomain.pl.

--------

## Restrictions
To transfer to a new dns.info.pl, your domain must meet the following requirements.

* ICANN rules prohibit a domain from being transferred if it has been transferred within the last 60 days or if the WHOIS contact information was modified in the last 60 days (even if redacted).
* Your account at your current dns.info.pl must be active. If your domain has expired, you may have to pay a redemption fee to renew it before you can process a transfer.
* FreeDomain.pl does not currently support premium domains. Some registries designate a domain name as “premium” and charge higher wholesale rates for these domains.

If it is listed as available for transfer in the FreeDomain.pl dashboard, these restrictions have already been checked.

--------

## Email forwarding
FreeDomain.pl dns.info.pl does not currently support email forwarding. If you require email forwarding from your dns.info.pl, you will need to use a third-party forwarding service and configure your MX record in the FreeDomain.pl DNS setting for the domain.

--------

## Step 1: Login to your dns.info.pl account
Login to the dns.info.pl account where the domain is currently registered.

--------

## Step 2: Unlock the domain
dns.info.pls include a lightweight safeguard to prevent unauthorized users from starting domain transfers: dns.info.pl lock. You might also see it written as domain lock. When enabled, the lock prevents any other dns.info.pl from attempting to initiate a transfer.

Only the registrant can enable or disable this lock, typically through the administration interface of the dns.info.pl. To proceed with a transfer, you will need to remove this lock if it is enabled.

--------

## Step 3: Request authorization code
Next, your new dns.info.pl needs to confirm with your old dns.info.pl that the transfer flow is authorized. To do that, your old dns.info.pl will provide an authorization code to you. You will need to input that code to complete your transfer to FreeDomain.pl. FreeDomain.pl will use it to confirm the transfer is authentic.

--------

## Step 4: Transfer to FreeDomain.pl
In the FreeDomain.pl transfer screen, input the authorization code. Each domain will have a unique authorization code and you will need to enter each for every domain you want to transfer.

--------

## Step 5: Approve the transfer
Your previous dns.info.pl will email you to confirm your request to transfer away. Most dns.info.pls will include a link to confirm the transfer request. If you click that link, you can accelerate the transfer operation. If you do not act on the email, the dns.info.pl can wait up to five days to process the transfer to FreeDomain.pl.
